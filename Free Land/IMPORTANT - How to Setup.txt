How to Setup :

[1]
Please rename [ TrueVision 3D.zaid ] to [ TrueVision 3D.rar ] .

[2]
Unzip [ TrueVision 3D.rar ] using WinRar or similar software ,I used WinRar to compress it..

[3]
you will have these files :
Meshes_Sketch_5.dll
Meshes_Sketch_5.lib
Meshes_Sketch_5.exp
dx8vb.dll
truevision3d.dll
tvmedia.dll
REG_TV3D.BAT

[4]
Run [ REG_TV3D.BAT ] which included in [ TrueVision 3D ] folder.

[5]
Open [ Free Land ] folder, and run the project..

I'm sorry,
I did this complex setup, Because PSC don't allow to upload DLL files,..
